Description: C Intermediate Language
 CIL is a front-end for the C programming language that facilitates program
 analysis and transformation. CIL will parse and typecheck a program, and
 compile it into a simplified subset of C. For example, in CIL all looping
 constructs are given a single form and expressions have no side-effects. This
 reduces the number of cases that must be considered when manipulating a C
 program. CIL has been used for a variety of projects, including CCured, a tool
 that makes C programs memory safe.
 .
 CIL supports ANSI C as well as most of the extensions of the GNU C and
 Microsoft C compilers. A Perl script acts as a drop in replacement for either
 gcc or Microsoft's cl, and allows merging of the source files in your project.
 Other features include support for control-flow and points-to analyses.
